Steps to completing a Professional Development Plan:
1. Assess where you are now.
· How is your career currently progressing? Assessing your current career situation is a good place to start. Ask yourself the following questions:
· What have you been doing over the past year, 3 years or 5 years to help your professional development?
· Are you where you thought you’d be at this stage in your career?
· If the answers are ‘nothing’ and ‘no’, a PDP is a great place to start to begin turning that around. Even if those were not your answers, this step will give you the chance to assess the effectiveness of the strategies and actions you have been taking in the past.
· Take this opportunity to reflect on your actions, and be honest with yourself. Identify, and write down, any actions that have specifically helped, or hindered, your professional development.
2. Identify your specific career goals.
· Where do you want to be?
· What does success mean to you?
· What activities do you love the most?
· Are you experiencing a version of this success in your current job?
· Where would you like to be in 5 years’ time? Ten years? This is a good time to identify your long-term goals.
Note:  Make sure that your goals are ‘SMART’:
· Specific.
· Measurable.
· Achievable.
· Realistic.
· Timely.
3. Gather information.
· What professional skills are needed to get where you want to go? After you have identified your long and short-term goals, researching what you need to achieve them is the next step.
· Identify what professional skills you already have and which you need to work on.
· Evaluate your professional skills.
· Now that you have identified what professional skills are desirable for your ideal career path, take a moment to tick off ones you’re already proficient in.
· Choose how you will accomplish your goals.
· Decide on a strategy.
4. Now that you have identified the areas you need to work on, it is time to decide how you will remedy this. To be effective, your professional development should be;
· Job embedded.
· Strategic.
· Continuous and ongoing.
5. Develop a timeline for accomplishing your specific targets and goals.
· It is important to decide when you want to achieve your goals and laying out a time-frame is an important factor in making sure that you stick to your PDP. Knowing you have given yourself a deadline means you are more likely to achieve your plans.
· Plan your targets on a yearly basis, make sure to give each target more time than you envision it taking because things rarely go to plan, and schedule your targets around opportunities you’d like to achieve
· Write it all down.
6. Keep detailed notes of your Professional Development Plan that you can update and alter as you go along.
· Evaluate your plan.
· Measure your progress
7. Are you meeting your targets? 
· Assessing your progress regularly is important. Even though you know your professional development is important (you’ve made a plan for it, after all) professional education can quickly fall in priority.
· Measuring your progress will help you know if you are hitting your ‘check lists’, meeting your targets and are on track for reaching your goals. You may need to set more manageable steps, or make new targets, or even set new goals.
8. Remember that plans change and, as you go through your career, your goals will progress with you. Learning is a lifelong process, and it’s important to continue your professional development to ensure career success.
